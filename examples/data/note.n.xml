Instead , the notes are backed , ultimately , by the full faith and credit of the US government.'' I think this means that they 'll redeem your worn-out dollars for crisp new ones. Sounds kinda wishy-washy , but it seems to work. To be fair , it 's a little more magical than that. A dollar is worth a dollar because Congress says it is legal tender : if a debt is denominated in dollars , then federal reserve bank notes have to be accepted in payment of it. It 's really beautiful when you think of -- an entire economy held together by an abstract set of mutual obligations to honor a money concept only symbolically and rather incompletely backed by anything of value.'' Of course , the value of the dollar in terms of anything other than dollars is variable . </note.n.10><note.n.11>Can anyone in a serious , straightforward way write an intellectually honest paragraph to back that up ?

( Federal Reserve Notes are not bank notes. ) However , this is only the superficial difference from United States Notes. Federal Reserve Notes , series 1963 , 1969 , 1974 are not redeemable into specie , as the prior series were , nor into anything but more of the same. Surely that has a meaning beyond the obvious one. The only other thing that these Notes are convertible into is United States government bonds. So , in effect , the Notes are merely " small change " for the bonds. They are the " till money " used by the banks to balance up the demand deposit accounts at the end of the day. If you have a large enough bundle of Federal Reserve Notes you can convert them into a bond by simply purchasing the bond , but never into specie , as that would defeat the scheme of liability on credit for filing an income tax return levied not at law but in equity , and executive equity at that . </note.n.22><note.n.23>Only the person who owes the money needs to sign it.

The balance owing in a demand promissory note does not need to be paid until the Lender demands to be repaid. In other words , the loan is repayable 'on demand'.

Arrays of a higher number of dimensions include sets of arrays of a smaller number of dimensions. In my system , I only consider higher numbers of sets of the same sizes : three-dimensional arrays consist of two-dimensional arrays of the same dimensions ( i.e. , four 5 x 4 arrays ) , and four-dimensional arrays sets of three-dimensional arrays ( i.e. four 4 x 5 x 4 arrays; in practice things rarely get this heavy ) . </note.n.37><note.n.38>The MIDI Monitor Filter window is very useful for focussing on specific types of MIDI events.

This of course applies to trance music too but often it does n't keep up the repetitive beat. Despite it 's name drum and bass it has many layers on top of the smooth bass line.

The most familiar of these is a set of four resonance filters , each with a frequency , bandwidth , and gain control. As with other parameters , frequency values are in relative increments ( 0 to 127 ) , with no indication of actual Hertz values. You enter values using the same three data-entry tools found in the Vibrato dialog ( Dot , Free , and Line ) , and if you 've ever drawn a controller curve for notes in a sequencer , you 'll get the process immediately . </note.n.43><note.n.44>Lieberman Forum ( Rochford testimony ) , supra note 30 , at 19.

In order , they are today : Do , Re , Mi , Fa , Sol , La , Ti , and Do ( for the octave ) . The classic variation is : Do , Re , Mi , Fa , Sol , La , Si , Do. These functional names of the musical notes were introduced by Guido of Arezzo ( c.991 after 1033 ) using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn Ut queant laxis. The original sequence was Ut , Re , Mi , Fa , Sol , La , where each verse would start a note higher. " Ut " later became " Do " .

The value of the Treasury Notes fell below that of specie. New England states were unsympathetic to the war and when the government attempted to withdraw deposits from a Boston bank to make interest payments on October 1 , 1814 , the bank took the position that it could tender Treasury Notes to the government which were then rejected by the holders of the government bonds who expected payment in specie. These developments led to changes in the final Treasury Note act of the era signed on February 24 , 1815. These last notes were divided into large ( $ 100 and over ) and small ( under $ 100 ) denominations , and did not expire at any predetermined time. The large notes paid interest as before , at 5 2/5 per annum , but could also be used to purchase 6 percent interest bonds at par ( i.e. were fundable into the bonds ) as a way of supporting their value . </note.n.51><note.n.52>Special Note : A few users have had troubles with the drivers that come with this device and Andrea has posted updated drivers for the Pure Audio series of products at this location : Software Update for USB Audio Products.

When played rapidly enough , they are still perceived as all part of the same chord. Listen to the following two examples of the same chords , one in chorale style , the other in an arpeggiated style : </note.n.67><note.n.68>Banker ' s Note.

This is the risk that the State will not be able ( a ) to recover deposits if the depository bank fails or ( b ) to recover the value of investments or collateral securities that are in the custody of an outside party if the counterparty to the investment or deposit transaction fails. Classification in category 1 means that the exposure of deposits or investments to potential custodial credit risk is low. The level of potential custodial credit risk is higher for those deposits or investments classified in category 2 , and highest for those in category 3 . </note.n.79><note.n.80>A.

They are best used for short term loans with duration of twelve months or less. With a lump sum repayment plan the borrower repays the entire amount of the loan on a specified date. If interest is included , the amount of both principal and interest should be clearly outlined in the promissory note , along with the repayment date . </note.n.92><note.n.93>Originally , the value of money was determined by the intrinsic value of the material the money was made of , such as silver or gold. However , carrying around a lot of precious metal was cumbersome and often dangerous. As an alternative , banknotes would be issued. In financial terms , a note is a promise to pay someone money. Banknotes were originally a promise to pay the bearer an amount of precious metal stored in a vault somewhere. In this way the stored value ( usually in gold or silver coins ) backing the banknote could transfer ownership in exchange for goods or services . </note.n.93><note.n.94>In 1863 , in order to help finance the Civil War , a system of national banks was instituted by the National Currency Act. The banks each had the power to issue standardized national bank notes based on United States bonds held by the bank. The early national banking system had two main weaknesses : an inelastic currency; and a lack of liquidity. [ 2 ] During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the United States economy went through a series of financial panics. [ 2 ] A particularly severe panic in 1907 provided the motivation for renewed demands for banking and currency reform. [ 3 ] The following year Congress enacted the Aldrich-Vreeland Act which provided for an emergency currency and established the National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency reform.

Of this sum , up to $ 50 , 000 , 000 was authorized as non-interest bearing Treasury Notes , payable upon demand , in denominations less than fifty dollars and not less than ten dollars. These were called Demand Notes to distinguish them from the interest-bearing Treasury Notes in existence at the time. The promise to pay " on demand " was a new obligation for Treasury Notes ( though common on private banknotes ) but would spare the cash-strapped Treasury the intermediate step of selling an equivalent amount of debt by allowing it to use the notes as a currency to pay creditors directly. The notes were to be redeemable through the Assistant Treasurers ' offices at Philadelphia </note.n.96><note.n.97>Installing Jot is rather easy , in spite of the PC-centric manual ( " Double-click the Palm Desktop icon on your Windows desktop ...

This work of Irenaeus , which is commonly known under its Latin title , Adversus Haereses ( Against Heresies ) , is still extant in a barbarous Latin version , of which we possess three mss. The original Greek is lost , though a great part of the first book can be recovered by means of extensive quotations made from it by Hippolytus and Epiphanius. The work is directed against the various Gnostic systems , among which that of Valentinus is chiefly attacked. The first book is devoted to a statement of their doctrines , the second to a refutation of them , and the remaining three to a presentation of the true doctrines of Christianity as opposed to the false positions of the Gnostics. The best edition of the original is that of Harvey : S. Irenaei libros quinque adv. Haereses. , Cambr. 1857 , 2 vols.; English translation in the Ante-Nicene Fathers , I. p. 309 ff. For the literature of the subject , see Schaff , II. p. 746 ff.
